### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my profile, often neglected, I generally use Github to get code for work projects.

### I do plan on putting home automation stuff here but havent gotten round to it yet... ðŸ™„ 

My work: I am an IoT developer, wearing many hats at a small company, undertaking technical sales, post sale support, R&D, product development, and some commissioning when required. 
Given the wide bredth of areas I work in I can turn my hand to most technologies or skills, having developed enclosures, electronics and the code to run on it through to working on our cloud infrastructure security and internal apps. 

On the side I advise/consult on smart building solutions.
